## **Data**

This project uses financial and behavioral data to train a monthly income prediction model.

Due to confidentiality reasons, the full datasets are not included in this repository. The `train.csv` and `test.csv` files used for training and evaluation are kept locally.

However, the repository includes:

- The complete notebook with the full modeling process  
- The applied methodology  
- The preprocessing and model evaluation logic
